**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**

**Project:Simple calculator**

**Welcome Message and Menu**:
    The program starts by displaying a welcome message and a menu of operations to the user. This helps the user understand what operations are available and how to interact with the program.

**Input Handling**:
    The user is prompted to enter their choice of operation by selecting a number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for division).
    The program then takes two numerical inputs from the user (num1 and num2).

**Performing Operations:**
    Depending on the user's choice of operation, the program performs the corresponding calculation:
    Addition: Adds num1 and num2.
    Subtraction: Subtracts num2 from num1.
    Multiplication: Multiplies num1 by num2.
    Division: Divides num1 by num2 (ensures num2 is not zero to avoid division by zero error).

**Output Result:**
    After performing the operation, the program displays the result to the user in a formatted string that shows the calculation and the result.

**Error Handling:**
    The program checks for division by zero when performing the division operation and provides an error message if num2 is zero.

**Functionality Encapsulation:**
    All the logic for displaying the menu, handling user input, performing calculations, and displaying results is encapsulated within a single function (calculator()). This makes the code modular and easy to understand.

**User Interaction:**
    Throughout the program, there are prompts and messages that guide the user on what input is expected and what operations are available. This improves the overall user experience and clarity of interaction.

**Example Usage:**
    Upon running the program, the user sees a menu and is prompted to enter their choice (e.g., 1 for addition).
    They input two numbers (e.g., 10 and 5).
    The program then calculates the result (e.g., 10 + 5 = 15) and displays it to the user.
    If the user selects division and attempts to divide by zero, an error message is displayed instead.

**Conclusion:**
    This calculator program demonstrates fundamental concepts in Python such as user input handling, conditional statements, basic arithmetic operations, function definition, and error handling. It provides a simple yet effective way for users to perform common calculations interactively.
